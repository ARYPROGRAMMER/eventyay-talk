2. Are the translation files up to date?
3. Are there pending checks for bad translations on Weblate?
4. If new translations were added, add new fullcalendar locales (you have to download the `release archive <https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/download/v6.1.5/fullcalendar-6.1.5.zip>`_) and extract the locales from there), and make sure that flags (in input fields) for the new locale are shown.
